You help users shop for recipe ingredients on the Kroger website. Users will give you ingredients from a recipe in <Ingredients> tags. We need to search Kroger for that ingredient and find the right amount of the ingredient to buy. Hence, your specific job is to convert user ingredient lists into Kroger search queries and estimated gram quantities.

Step 1: Think about your answer in a <Thinking> tag. First think about what the ingredient is. Determine the best search query to use on Kroger's website to find it. If there is ambiguity, pick the less expensive version of the ingredient. Second, estimate the mass of the ingredient in grams using USDA reference values where helpful. Some ingredients will be very easy: 1 oz of chicken is just 28 g of chicken. Some will be harder: one bay leaf is 0.2 g of bay leaf. Show detailed working for more difficult conversions.
Step 2: output your answer in an <Answer> tag as a csv with a row for each ingredient. Follow the format in the <Example>.

Let's go through each ingredient and decide on a query and gram amount.
1. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "frozen mixed vegetables". The conversion to grams is also simple. 24 oz = 24 oz * 28.35 g/oz = 680.4 g
2. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "vegetable broth". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 cup of vegetable broth: 1 cup = 221 g. Hence 2 cups broth = 2 * 221 g = 442 g.
3. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "coconut milk". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 fluid ounce of coconut milk: 1 fl oz = 30.5 g. Hence 13.5 fl oz broth = 13.5 * 30.5 g = 411.75 g.
4. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "curry powder". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 tablespoon of curry powder: 1 tbsp = 6.3 g. Hence 1 tbsp curry powder = 6.3 g.
5. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "ground ginger". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 teaspoon of ground ginger: 1 tsp = 1.8 g. Hence 1/2 tsp ground ginger = 0.5 * 1.8 g = 0.9 g.
6. This is a difficult query. Unfortunately Kroger won't have an item called salt and pepper. We can only search for one item, so I will follow the guidance and search for salt because it is cheaper. We will set the query to "salt". For "to taste" amounts, we can estimate. Typically, a pinch of salt is about 1/8 tsp (according to the USDA, 1 tsp = 6 g). Total estimate: 0.125 * 6 = 0.75 g.
7. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "butter". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 tablespoon of butter: 1 tbsp = 14.2 g. Hence 2 tbsp butter = 2 * 14.2 g = 28.4 g.
8. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "garlic cloves". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 clove of garlic: 1 clove = 3 g. Hence 2 cloves garlic = 2 * 3 g = 6 g.
9. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "chicken broth". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 cup of chicken broth: 1 cup = 249 g. Hence 1.5 cups chicken broth = 1.5 * 249 g = 373.5 g.
10. Simple query. Kroger should have an item called "milk". We can use the standard USDA reference value for 1 cup of whole milk: 1 cup = 244 g. Hence 1.5 cups milk = 1.5 * 244 g = 366 g.
