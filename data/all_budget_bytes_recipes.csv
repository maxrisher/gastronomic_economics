https://www.budgetbytes.com/almond-dutch-baby-with-ricotta-and-jam/,Almond Dutch Baby with Ricotta and Jam,4.92,12,20 minutes,20 minutes,"1. Prepare the batter first, so it has some time to come up to room temperature. In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, almond extract and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth and no lumps remain. Let the batter sit at room temperature to warm.
2. Place a 10-inch cast iron skillet in the oven and begin preheating to 425ºF. Let the skillet heat in the oven for an additional 10 minutes once the oven reaches the set temperature.

https://www.budgetbytes.com/almost-eggs-benedict/,Almost Eggs Benedict,4.79,14,10 minutes,25 minutes,"1. Separate the whites from the yolk of ONE egg. Add the yolk to a small sauce pot along with 1 Tbsp water and about 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice (I like my hollandaise quite lemony, if you don’t, start with 1 tsp lemon juice). Whisk them together until smooth. The pot is not over heat at this point.
2. Cut 4 Tbsp butter into 1/2 Tbsp chunks, then place them in the sauce pot with the egg, water, and lemon juice. Finally, place the pot over LOW heat and whisk continuously, allowing the butter to slowly melt into the yolk as you whisk. It should take 2-3 minutes for the butter to melt.
3. When the butter is fully melted, continue to whisk continuously and vigorously. As the mixture continues to heat, the yolk will begin to cook and solidify, which will thicken the sauce into a light, velvety mixture. It should take about 3-5 minutes for the mixture to cook to the point where it is thickened and will first look frothy, then finally begin to thicken. Once thickened, remove it from the heat. Taste the sauce and season with a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper. If you prefer more lemon, it can be whisked in at this point. Place a lid on the pot and set it near the burner that will be used for the eggs and ham, but not over direct heat, to keep it slightly warm.
4. Add about 1 tsp butter to a large skillet and place it over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt, then tilt the skillet to coat the surface. Open the English muffins and place them cut sides down in the skillet. Cook them until browned, then flip an cook a couple minutes more on the other side (about 5 minutes total). Place the buttery toasted muffins on your plates.
5. Wipe out the skillet to remove any cornmeal from the muffins, then add another teaspoon of butter. Once melted, add the ham slices to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides (another 3-5 minutes). If your ham slices are large like mine were, cut them in half to better fit the English muffins. Once browned, place the ham pieces on the toasted English muffins.
6. Turn the heat down to medium-low, add another teaspoon of butter to the skillet and cook two of the eggs until the whites are set, but the yolks are still runny. I find using a slightly lower heat helps give the whites time to heat through and cook before cooking the yolk. Top the muffins and ham with the eggs.
7. Finally, drizzle the prepared hollandaise sauce over the eggs and ham on the English muffins, and enjoy.",2,19.05,1.5,519.95,38.55,24.3,1067.2

If you don’t have a wire mesh sieve, place the quinoa in a bowl, fill it with cool water and swish the quinoa around. Allow it to settle and then carefully pour out the water. Repeat 4-5 times. Rinsing quinoa well is essential to remove its natural coating, which can cause the quinoa to taste bitter.

2. Line your pie pan with the rolled out bottom crust. Beat the egg white and brush the bottom crust lightly with it. Use a fork to puncture the bottom crust 9 to 10 times. Refrigerate the crust-lined pie pan.
3. Slice the 6 to 8 apples into 1/4 inch thick slices until you have 6 cups. Then place them in a colander and dress them with the lemon juice.
4. Place the colander in a large sauce pan. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, salt, flour, and nutmeg. Sprinkle the apples with the sugar mixture and incorporate thoroughly.
5. Allow the apples to marinate in the sugar and spices for a half hour. They will release their juices into the sauce pan.
6. After the apples have released their juices, remove the colander and the apples and place the pan with the juices over medium heat. Cook down the apple juices until a caramel forms.
7. Add the sliced apples to the pan and cook with the caramel until slightly softened, about five minutes. Let them cool for about 10 minutes.

2. Heat a large skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium high heat. While the skillet is heating, remove the pork chops from their package and sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Once the skillet is very hot but not smoking (the oil should look wavy on the surface), add the chops to the skillet. Over crowding the skillet will cause the heat to drop and prevent searing so cook the chops in batches of two. Cook on each side until browned (about 5 minutes each side). NOTE: The chops will stick to the pan initially, but they will naturally be released from the surface when a “sear” has been achieved. If the chop is still sticking to the pan that means it is not ready to flip yet.
4. When the chops finish searing, remove them to a clean plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Once all of the chops have cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and pour the apricot sauce into the skillet. Using a whisk, stir and cook the sauce for 1-2 minutes. The whisk will help the pan drippings release from the bottom of the pan and flavor the sauce. This is called “deglazing.”
5. Either serve the pork chops with the sauce spooned over top or add the chops back to the warm skillet to coat with sauce. I spooned the sauce over top for presentation’s sake but in the future I’ll probably add them to the pan to completely coat with the yummy sauce!",4,25,0.43,337.7,14.93,26.4,301.88

To prepare the galette crust, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the cold butter into chunks and add it to the flour and salt. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the flour until the flour looks like damp sand with some pea-sized pieces of butter.
2. Begin adding ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until a dough forms and no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Shape the dough into a flattened disc, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for one hour or until solid.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the room temperature cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and 1 tsp juice from the lemon until it forms a smooth mixture. Save the egg white to brush over the crust just before baking.
5. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Lightly flour a clean work surface. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it into a 14-16 inch circle. The dough may seem a little stiff at first, but it will become more pliable as it warms. Make sure to keep your work surface dusted with flour as you roll to keep the dough from sticking.
6. Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Transfer the rolled dough onto the parchment (you can either roll or fold the dough to transfer without ripping). Spread the cream cheese mixture over the center of the circle, leaving about 2-inches of bare dough around the outside edge. I like to leave a higher “lip” on the outer edge of the cream cheese to help hold in the berries and their juice.
7. Stir the blueberries one last time and pour them over the cream cheese, including all of the juice from the bowl. Begin folding up the sides of the dough over the cream cheese and berries, leaving the center open.
8. Whisk the reserved egg white with a fork, using a drop or two of water to make it more fluid, if needed. Brush the egg white over the surface of the galette dough.

Allow the rice to cool slightly.
4. While the rice is cooking, prepare the lemon parsley mix. Pull the leaves from about 1/2 bunch of parsley. Finely chop the leaves until they appear minced. Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from one lemon. Combine the minced parsley, about 1/2 Tbsp lemon zest, and olive oil in a small bowl.
5. When the rice has cooled just slightly, add the lemon parsley mix and fold gently until the rice is coated in parsley, lemon, and olive oil. Avoid vigorous stirring, as this can make the rice pasty.
6. Adjust the oven rack to the second position from the top and preheat the broiler on high. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment. Spread the marinated vegetables out over the surface of the baking sheet. If they do not cover the sheet in a single layer, use two baking sheets to avoid over crowding.

Take one chipotle pepper out of the can, mince it, and then add it to the bowl along with about one teaspoon of the adobo sauce from the can.
5. Once the sweet potato is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and add it to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Stir everything together and then either use a potato masher or the back of a fork to slightly mash the beans. Cover and chill the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the cornmeal to absorb some of the moisture.
6. Divide the sweet potato mixture into four (or six) portions and shape each into a patty, approximately 3/4 inch thick. Use the remaining 1/4 cup of cornmeal to coat the outside of the patties. This will provide a nice crunch to the burger.
7. To cook the patties in a skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon of cooking oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot (it should look wavy on the surface), add two of the patties. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until the patties are golden brown. Add more oil and cook the remaining two patties. Remember to turn the patties carefully as they are quite soft and can fall apart.
8. To cook the patties in the oven, Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and then coat lightly with non-stick spray. Place the patties on the foil and then spritz the top of the patties lightly with non-stick spray (this will help it crisp up). Bake for 25 minutes, or until the patties are heated through and the bottoms are golden brown.
9. Spread one tablespoon of mayonnaise on each bun and top with a chipotle sweet potato patty. Slice the avocado and place 1/4 of the slices on top of each burger. Top with extra cilantro leaves, if desired.",4,18.53,20.43,693.28,29.7,91.95,1268.33

3. After two hours, sprinkle some flour on the expanded dough and on a clean work surface. Flour your hands and transfer the dough to the work surface. Give the dough just a few quick “kneads” just to make sure it is evenly mixed (honestly only 3 or for turns/folds). Shape the dough into a long rectangle with the short end the same length as your bread pan (see photos).
4. Roughly chop the chocolate chips into small pieces. Sprinkle them over the surface of the bread dough. Working from the short end, stretch and roll the dough up with the chopped chocolate inside. Stretch the dough as you roll and roll tightly so that there as much “swirl” as possible.
5. Place the rolled up dough, seam side down, in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray. Cover loosely and let rise until double in size (about one hour).
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, place the risen loaf inside, and bake until deep golden brown on top (about 35 minutes). Remove the baked loaf from the pan and let cool on a wire rack before cutting open. Enjoy!",12,4.88,3.3,176.83,3.28,34.48,247.59

5. Bake the chicken for 40-45 minutes, basting once or twice throughout. For more browning, turn the broiler on at the end of the cooking time and broil for 2-4 minutes, or until the desired amount of browning is achieved. The total cooking time will ultimately depend on the size of your drumsticks and how closely they are packed together in the baking dish. Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat has reached 160ºF to be sure.

2. In a large bowl combine 2 cups of the flour and the salt. Stir to combine. Add the frothy yeast water and stir well until everything is evenly mixed. Continue adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until it is too hard to stir by hand (about one cup later). Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and continue adding flour a little bit at a time and knead in until you have reached 3.5 to 4 cups total (depending on the humidity). You can stop adding flour when it becomes fairly stiff but still pliable enough to knead. Knead the dough for 8 minutes total.
3. After kneading, flatten the dough slightly and add the cinnamon and raisins down the center. Fold the dough over and knead a few more times until the raisins are even throughout the dough and the cinnamon has given the dough a swirly appearance. The raisins and cinnamon may “break out” of the dough while you knead it in but just keep going and let the dough pick it back up as you knead.
4. Form the dough into a ball, loosely cover and let it rise until double (about 45 min.). Punch the down down, form it into a log and cut it into 10 pieces (for medium bagels). Form each piece into a ball by pulling the dough back and under itself. When you have a smooth ball, pinch it in the center to make the hole then carefully stretch the hole until it is a couple inches across. Make the hole about 3x larger than you think it should be because the dough will puff up quite a bit during cooking and close the hole off. Form the rest of the bagels in the same manner.
5. Place the formed bagels on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and cornmeal or non-stick spray. Let rise until double in size (about 45 minutes). Preheat your broiler near the end of the rise time.
6. Put a large pot of water on to boil. While you wait for it to boil, place the tray of bagels under the broiler for one minute. Pull the bagels out, carefully turn them over then place them back in to broil on the second side. Every oven is different so watch the bagels closely. You do not want them to brown just turn slightly dull on the surface.
7. Once the bagels have broiled on both sides, turn the oven to 375 to preheat. When the water has come to a full, rolling boil, drop the bagels in a few at a time. Boil the bagels for one minute, flip them over and boil for another minute on the opposite side. I found that a long chopstick works well for flipping them in the boiling water.
8. As the bagels come out of the water, let them drain on a wire cooling rack so the bottoms don’t get soggy. After draining for about 5 minutes, place them on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden brown.",10,5.65,2.06,213.31,0.58,46.31,356.24

2. Add the warm water and stir. If the dough does not come into one cohesive ball (with no dry bits left at the bottom of the bowl) add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it all comes together (see photos below). Loosely cover the bowl and let it rest for 2 hours at room temperature.
3. After two hours the dough will have risen and grown to about twice the size. It will be a rough looking, shaggy ball of dough. Turn it out onto a floured surface. Give it maybe one or two turns or “kneads” in the flour just to work in enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. Flatten and stretch the dough into a long rectangle. The short side of the rectangle should be the same length as your bread pan, the long side double that.
4. Sprinkle the cinnamon over the surface of the rectangle. If you want a sweeter bread, you can sprinkle on some additional brown sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the rectangle up and place it in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray. Let the bread rise for 1.5 hours or until it has risen up and out of the pan.
5. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Brush the top of the bread with water and bake for approximately 30 minutes or until the top is a deep golden brown. After baking, turn it out of the bread pan onto a wire cooling rack. Let cool completely before slicing.",12,4.91,2.45,157.7,0.77,33.72,248.32

Warm chicken will cause the greens to wilt prematurely. Cover the chicken with plastic, then pound with a rolling pin until it an even thickness. This will help the breast cook evenly. Season both sides of the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.
2. Heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat, then swirl to coat the surface of the skillet in oil. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook on each side for 5-7 minutes, or until it is well browned on the outside and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board, let it rest for five minutes, then dice it into small pieces. Place the chopped chicken in a bowl and refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
3. Add one inch of water in a pot, place a lid on top, then bring to a boil over high heat. Place four large eggs in a steaming basket, and once the water is boiling, carefully lower the basket into the pot. Replace the lid on top and allow the eggs to steam for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, transfer the steaming basket and eggs to a bowl full of ice water to cool.

6. When the muffins are large and fluffy, it’s time to cook them in a skillet. Heat a cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium low heat. Once the skillet is preheated, carefully use a spatula to lift 3-4 muffins from the baking sheet and slide them into the skillet, along with some cornmeal. Let the muffins cook 3-4 minutes, or until lightly golden brown on the bottom. Carefully flip the muffins and cook for 3-4 minutes on the second side. The muffins will puff further as they cook in the skillet. Once the muffins are golden on both sides and sound hollow when tapped, transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
7. Once completely cool, split the muffins with a fork and toast in a toaster or the oven. Or, transfer the cooled muffins to an air-tight container and keep in the refrigerator for up to one week, or the freezer for up to three months.",12,3.94,1.06,154,2.64,28.09,168.75

Half will be the marinade and half will be the dipping sauce – it MUST stay separate. Keep the sauce refrigerated until ready to use.
2. Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat and slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick strips. You should get about 14-16 strips total. Place the sliced chicken in a bag or bowl with half of the honey mustard sauce and stir to coat. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or over night.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Prepare a dredging station by lining a large baking sheet with foil and then placing two wire cooling racks on top. The wire racks keep the strips lifted as they bake so that the bottoms will crisp too. Coat the wire racks with non-stick spray. Pour the panko crumbs into a wide, shallow bowl.
4. One by one, coat the chicken strips with panko crumbs. Do not wipe off excess honey mustard sauce before coating with panko, the sauce helps it adhere. Place the strips on the wire rack as you bread them. Continue until all of the strips are coated with panko crumbs. Discard the leftover honey mustard sauce that the chicken was marinating in.
5. Bake the chicken strips in the oven until the crumbs have turned golden brown (about 30 minutes). To Fry: Alternatively, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the surface of the oil looks wavy. Fry a few strips at a time on each side until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on a plate covered with paper towels.

2. While the yeast is activating, roughly chop the sunflower seeds with either a knife or a mini-food processor. Add the chopped sunflower seeds to a large bowl with one cup of the whole wheat flour and the salt. Stir until evenly combined.
3. By this point the yeast should be foamy and frothy in the water. Add the olive oil to the yeast water and then pour it all into the bowl with the flour and sunflower seeds. Stir until the mixture is fairly smooth.
4. Add the last half cup of whole wheat flour and stir until it is incorporated. Add a half cup of all-purpose flour and stir until it forms a loose, shaggy ball of dough.
5. Take the dough out of the bowl and place it onto a floured work surface. Knead the dough for five minutes, slowly adding more all-purpose flour as you go. After five minutes of kneading, the dough should be soft, supple, not sticky, and will spring back when poked gently with your finger. You should use between 1 1/2 to 2 cups of all-purpose flour total (including what was added when it was in the bowl).
6. Place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rise for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until double in size.
7. Once it is double in size, deflate it, divide it in half, and form it into two balls. Place the balls on a large baking sheet covered with parchment paper, cover with a damp towel, and allow them to rise until double again (1 to 1.5 hrs).
8. Begin preheating the oven to 400 degrees. Separate the egg white and yolk. Whisk a tablespoon of water into the egg white and then brush it over the tops of each loaf. The egg wash is optional, but it will create a nice deep brown, glossy crust.
9. Take a sharp knife (a micro-serrated bread knife or a very sharp chef's knife) and carefully slice an ""X"" in the top of each loaf. Be sure to use no downward pressure while doing this, just carefully drag the knife horizontally or you'll deflate the loaf.

2. Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture. Next, stir one cup of whole wheat flour into the wet ingredients until evenly mixed. Stir in the all purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon.
3. Turn the ball of dough out onto a floured surface and continue to add in and knead the all purpose flour until the ball of dough is stretchy and soft but not sticky (about 3-5 minutes). The total amount of flour needed will depend on how much moisture is already in your flour but it should be between 1-2 cups of all purpose flour.
4. Spray a large bowl with nonstick spray and place the ball of dough inside. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let sit for about 45 minutes or until doubled in size.
5. To shape the dough, remove it from the bowl it was rising in and place it on a floured surface. Press the dough down into a large circle. This should be fairly easy since it was pretty circular in shape as it rose. Next, pick the dough up with your hands and transfer it to a pizza pan (coated in non-stick spray or sprinkled with corn meal). Press the dough out even further until it reaches the edges of the pan. Alternatively, you can pick the dough up and stretch it with your fists (this can take practice).

3. Pat the turkey breast dry, then spread the herb butter mixture all over the surface.
4. Transfer the stuffing to the bottom of an 8×8-inch casserole dish and place the turkey breast on top. The turkey should cover nearly all of the stuffing. If there is a lot of stuffing exposed, use foil to cover the stuffing mix to prevent it from browning too much during the hour and a half in the oven.
5. Transfer the turkey and stuffing to the oven (upper rack) and roast for about 1.5 hours, or until the internal temperature of the turkey breast reaches 165ºF.
6. After roasting, let the turkey and stuffing rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. The stuffing under the turkey will have absorbed quite a bit of moisture from the turkey, while the stuffing on the edges will be quite crunchy. Simply stir the stuffing together and let it sit for about five minutes to rehydrate the drier pieces before serving.

Beat together the butter and cream cheese in a large mixing bowl. Once combined, add 1 cup flour the sugar, and beat again until combined. The mixture may look dry and crumbly, but should stick together when squeezed with your hands. Form the mixture into a ball, adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour if it becomes too sticky.
2. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. The easiest way to do this is to first divide the dough into four equal-sized pieces, then divide each of those into three. Roll each piece into a ball, then place each one in the well of a regular-sized muffin tin (NOT a mini muffin tin). The muffin tin does not need to be greased.
3. Use your fingers to press the dough balls into the bottom and up the sides of the muffin tin wells. It’s okay if the dough does not reach the very top of the well. Make sure to press it deep into the corners, to avoid rounded thick corners. Place a dime-sized piece of chocolate into each of the shaped pie crusts. I used about 50 grams of the chocolate in the bottom of the pies, and the rest was used to drizzle on top after baking.
4. To make the filling, add the beaten egg, brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and pecans in a small mixing bowl. Stir to combine, avoiding beating the mixture too much or causing frothy air bubbles.
5. Spoon the mixture evenly between each of the pie crusts. The filling will only fill each pie crust about half way, but will puff up as it bakes. Once filled, place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes.
6. Once the pies are baked, melt the remaining 25 grams of chocolate. You can melt it using a microwave, heating for 15 seconds at a time and stirring well after each heating, until melted, or by placing a small bowl over a double boiler. Once melted, drizzle the chocolate over each pie.

Let sit for five minutes, or until it is frothy on top. Meanwhile, stir together two cups of the flour and 1/2 tsp of salt in a large bowl.
2. Once the yeast water is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour and salt. Stir the ingredients together until they form a shaggy ball of dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 minutes, incorporating an additional 1/2 to 1 cup of flour as you knead.
3. After the dough has been kneaded for 8 minutes, it should be smooth, elastic, and will spring back when poked with a finger. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover lightly, and let rise for one hour or until double in size.
4. Once the dough is double in size, punch the dough down, turn it out onto a clean surface, and flatten it into a disc. Cut the disc into 16 equal sized wedges. One by one, roll each wedge into a long rope, about 1/2 in diameter (about 18 inches long). Cut the rope into one inch sections, and place them on a baking sheet that has been covered with parchment and lightly misted with non-stick spray (you’ll need two sheets to fit all the pretzel bites).
5. Let the pretzel bites rise for 30 minutes, or until soft and pillowy. Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, carefully add 1/4 cup of baking soda (it will fizz and bubble furiously for a moment, so be careful).
6. Add 15-20 of the pretzel bites at a time to the boiling baking soda water and boil for about 90 seconds, or until puffed and a few begin to crack. Stir lightly as they boil to make sure all sides of the pretzel bites contact the boiling water. Remove the boiled pretzel bites with a slotted spoon and let drain on a wire cooling rack.

Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in. See photos below.
2. Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.
3. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third. Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp of water helps break it up).
4. One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.
5. Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and you’ll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.

2. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of flour (half whole wheat in my case) and the salt. Stir them so they are evenly combined. Add the small bowl of liquid to the bowl with the flour. Stir to combine.
3. Continue mixing in flour until it forms a loose ball that you can no longer stir with a spoon. Turn the ball of dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead in more flour until a soft and pliable (but not sticky) ball forms.

4. Place the ball of dough in an oiled bowl, cover loosely and let sit to rise for one hour or until doubled in size.
5. Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Stretch the dough into a log and cut it into 8 (or 6) equal sized pieces. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball and then roll it out into a flat, 6 inch diameter circle.
6. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and let the dough circles rest as the oven comes up to temp. Place a damp cloth over the dough circles so they do not dry out. When the oven is hot enough, place the dough circles on a wire rack (a couple at a time) and place the rack in the oven. Watch the circles puff up as they bake. When the circle has completely inflated but not yet turned brown you can remove it from the oven and put in the next batch. If you let the pitas cook until golden brown they will be crispier and may retain the inflated shape as they cool.

3. Add the olive oil to the yeast water, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour and salt. Begin adding more flour to the bowl, ¼ to ½ cup at a time, until it forms a ball of dough that can no longer be stirred with a spoon.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, then knead for about 5 minutes, adding a little flour as you go to keep it from sticking.
5. At this point you have three options: use the dough tonight (one hour after kneading), use it tomorrow (allowing it to rise in the refrigerator over night) or within a month (freezing the dough).
6. Place the kneaded dough back into the mixing bowl, drizzle with a little oil, then turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl loosely and let the dough rise in a warm place for one hour, or until it is double in volume.
7. Once risen, stretch or roll the dough out to a 14 to 16-inch circle, place on a pizza pan, and top with your favorite sauce and toppings. Bake the pizza in a preheated 450ºF oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy.

https://www.budgetbytes.com/pork-ginger-pot-stickers/,Pork & Ginger Pot Stickers,4.75,4,45 minutes,30 minutes,"1. Peel off the outer leaves from the cabbage. Slice the head in half and remove the core (see photos below). Cut each half into two then cut crosswise as thinly as possible. You need a very small shred to make the pot stickers easy to fill and fold.
2. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of oil over medium/high heat. When it’s hot, add the cabbage and 1/2 tsp of salt. Saute the cabbage until it is translucent and soft (about 15 minutes). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
3. While the cabbage is sauteing (stir every minute or so), combine the raw ground pork, peeled and grated ginger (use a small cheese grater), minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sliced green onion an shredded carrot. Mix them all together well with your hands. Add the shredded and cooked cabbage and mix again until it is evenly incorporated (you almost have to use your hands here). Refrigerate the mixture for at least one hour to let the flavors blend. (The cabbage will release gasses as it refrigerates and smell pretty stinky when you come back to it but don’t be afraid. It’s still good and the smell will go away when you cook the pot stickers.)
4. Prepare your workspace by getting a small dish of water (used to glue the edges together), something to fold the pot stickers on (I used a cutting board) and something to keep them on once folded (another cutting board or large plate). I used square wrappers so the wrapping technique below is based on that. There are many methods to folding pot stickers/won tons so if you have a different shape, simply do a google search for “folding won tons” or “folding pot stickers” to see more methods.
5. To make things easier, fill and fold the wontons in groups. I filled and folded three then moved on to the next group. Take three won ton wrappers and lay them on your surface. Using your finger, wet all the way around the edge of the wrapper. Place about 1 tsp of pork filling in the center of each square. Fold the square over diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner. Press down all along the seam to make the wet edges stick. Squeeze out all of the air in the process.
6. Take the two points of the triangle that are furthest from each other and wrap them around front and pinch together (use a bit more water to glue it together). The pot sticker is now folded! Fold the rest in the same manner. Once all of the pot stickers are folded, you can either cook all of them or freeze some on a cookie sheet. Once they are completely frozen solid, transfer them to an air tight freezer bag for storage. You can take them out and cook them as usual at a later date!
7. In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water and 3 bouillon cubes to a boil. Once it reaches a hard boil, drop in about half of the pot stickers. Boil them until they begin to float (about 7 minutes) then transfer to a cooling rack to drain. Place a baking sheet under the cooling rack to catch any water that drips off.
8. Once the pot stickers are done boiling and have drained for a minute or two they are ready to fry. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium/high heat. Spray it generously with non-stick spray. Using a non-stick pan with non-stick spray is the easiest way to make the pot stickers crispy without having them stick, tear and use a ton of oil. Pan fry the pot stickers on each side until golden brown and crispy (2-3 min on each side).

3. Spoon about one teaspoon of the pork mixture into the center of a wrapper. Dip a finger in water and wet the outer rim of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to close (here is a video demonstrating different folding styles).
4. When ready to cook the gyoza, heat 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the gyoza with the seam side up, and fry until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Using the lid as a shield, pour about 1/4 to 1/3 cup water into the skillet and quickly place the lid on top to contain the steam and splatter.

3. Secure the lid, set the pressure cooker to high pressure. Once it reaches full pressure, cook for 30 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally. If using a slow cooker, cook on low heat for 8-9 hours or high heat for 4-5 hours.
4. Once the chicken is finished cooking, carefully lift it out of the cooker and place it on a baking sheet. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the meat will be 6-8 inches from the broiler. Turn the broiler on to high, place the chicken in the oven, and let it broil for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken skin is brown and crispy. Keep a close eye on the chicken while it’s under the broiler, as it can burn quickly.
5. While the chicken is broiling, pour the remaining liquid (broth) from the pressure cooker through a sieve to strain out any bone or skin fragments. Measure the broth to see how much was left behind. You’ll want three cups of broth. If you have less, simply add enough water to make three cups of broth total. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.
6. Add the broth plus 1.5 cups of uncooked long grain white rice back to the pressure cooker. Secure the lid and select the rice function. Once the rice had finished cooking, allow the pressure to decrease naturally, open the cooker, then fluff with a fork.

Place the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and peeled garlic on a large baking sheet.
2. Drizzle the olive oil over the chopped vegetables, toss to coat, then season with a couple pinches of salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for about 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes or so.
3. While the vegetables are roasting, begin the couscous. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a small sauce pot. Once boiling, stir in the couscous. Place a lid on top, remove the pot from the heat, and let the couscous sit for five minutes, or until all of the broth is absorbed. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then place in the refrigerator to begin cooling as you prepare the rest of the meal.
4. While the couscous is chilling, begin the garlic herb baked chicken. Combine the room temperature butter with the parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until it forms a paste.
5. If the chicken breasts are thick, gently pound them with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness, no more than 3/4-inch thick (I cover the chicken with plastic to prevent splatter when pounding). Pat the chicken dry, then smear the butter herb mixture over the entire surface.

4. While the beef patties are cooking, slice the mushrooms. After removing the beef from the skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and the remaining sliced onion along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to cook the mushrooms and onions over medium until they are soft. Allow the moisture released from the onions and mushrooms to help you dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet as you stir.
5. Once the mushrooms and onions have softened and most of the moisture has evaporated off the bottom of the skillet, add the butter and flour. Continue to stir and cook for about two minutes. The flour and butter will form a paste and begin to coat the bottom of the skillet.
6. Add the beef broth and one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir to dissolve the flour into the broth, making sure to dissolve any flour that is stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to come up to simmer (still over medium heat), stirring often.

4. Fold about 1/3 of the cocoa almond mixture at a time into the whipped egg whites until no dry powder remains. After all of the dry mixture has been folded in, the mixture should have the consistency of thick, hot lava.
5. Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a pastry bag to pipe the macaron mixture into 1.5 inch rounds on the parchment paper. Leave enough space for the macarons to spread slightly without touching. After piping all of the macarons onto the sheet, slam the baking sheet on a counter a few times to force any larger air bubbles to the surface. Let the cookies sit out at room temperature for about 30 minutes so that the surface dries slightly (this helps form a ""foot"" or ruffle on the bottom of the macaron).

The fastest way to do this is in the microwave. Prick the skin of each potato with a fork. Wrap one potato in a paper towel, place it on a plate, and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Carefully remove it from the microwave, squeeze it to make sure it’s soft in the center, and the allow it cool as you cook the next one. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them open and scoop the flesh into a large bowl.
2. Slice the green onions and roughly chop a handful of cilantro (about 1/8th of a bunch). Add the green onions, cilantro, frozen corn kernels, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper to the bowl with the cooked sweet potatoes. Stir until well combined. You can taste it at this point and adjust the seasoning as desired.
3. Add the breadcrumbs, cornmeal, and egg to the bowl. These ingredients will bind the mixture together and keep it from falling apart while cooking. Stir until evenly combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to absorb moisture.
